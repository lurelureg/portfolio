                As a seasoned Brand Strategist and Communication Designer since
                2010, I&apos;ve been at the forefront of crafting compelling
                brand identities and designing impactful visual communication
                strategies. My expertise spans diverse industries, including
                environmental nonprofits, healthcare, wellness, virtual events,
                and civic organizations. I specialize in bridging business
                values and objectives into compelling discourses that resonate
                with target audiences.
                <br />
                My educational background includes a Diploma in Graphic &
                Advertising Design, a Certificate Program in{" "}
                <strong>Creativity for Advertising</strong> . I further pursued
                a BA in Human-Centered Design.
                <br /> <br />
                I enjoyed complementing my experience teaching and mentoring in
                Graphic Design, I led the development of courses for
                professionals, emphasizing the creation of complete design
                projects. Guiding students, I provided hands-on leadership,
                ensuring successful outcomes and contributing to their final
                degree achievements.
                <br />
                <br />I recently completed a Bootcamp in <strong>UX/UI</strong>,
                and another in Web <strong>Web Development</strong>. I consider
                a continuous pursuit of education is key to staying ahead in the
                ever-changing landscape of design and technology.
                <br />
                When I&apos;m not studying or collaging, you&apos;ll find me
                exploring the infinite city of Berlin, hunting for stucco
                sculptures and unusual plants.
                <br />
                <br /> I&apos;m currently on the lookout for an amazing team to
                join. I thrive in multidisciplinary environments, where I can
                empower others and create something beyond great together.
                I&apos;m excited to take on new challenges and make a real
                impact. Let&apos;s make things happen! <br />
