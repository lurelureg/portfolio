                With over a decade of experience in communication design,
                I&apos;ve become a pro at bringing creativity to life through
                eye-catching designs. <br />
                <br />
                Art and design run deep in my veins. My mom&apos;s an architect,
                artist, and crafter, and my dad&apos;s an engineer. I guess you
                could say I inherited by force of habit&#40;at&#41; the perfect
                blend of <strong>creativity</strong> and
                <strong>problem-solving skills.</strong>
                <br />
                <br />I studied at a local school of arts and crafts,
                specializing in visual design for advertising. It was always
                about the community, the audience, in the end the user. This
                orientation fueled my passion to pursue a Bachelor&apos;s degree
                in <strong>Human Centered Design</strong> in the same
                institution.
                <br />
                <br />
                What keeps me going is the ever-changing world of technology.
                I&apos;m a fast learner, always ready to embrace new skills and
                stay ahead of the game. I have recently completed a
                <strong>Web Development</strong>
                bootcamp to bring my collaboration with devs to seamless flow.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                When I&apos;m not studying or collaging, you&apos;ll find me
                exploring the infinite city of Berlin, hunting for stucco
                sculptures and unusual plants.
                <br />
                <br /> Right now, I&apos;m on the lookout for an amazing team to
                join. I thrive in multidisciplinary environments, where I can
                empower others and create something beyond great together.
                I&apos;m excited to take on new challenges and make a real
                impact. Let&apos;s make things happen! <br />
